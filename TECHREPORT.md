# **The Cabot Tech Report**
> Cabot has undergone a transformative technological evolution! By embracing the cutting-edge Bun.sh runtime and a full TypeScript rewrite, Cabot achieves unprecedented performance—up to 10x faster. This innovation, paired with groundbreaking features like Entity Manipulation Technology Systems, seamlessly blends modern technomancy with ancient mysticism to craft personalized, occult experiences for every user.

## **The TechnoRandomizer**
File: `src/utils/TechnoRandomizer.ts`
> The TechnoRandomizer is an advanced utility allowing entities like deities, spirits, or unseen forces to subtly manipulate outcomes via technomancy. This introduces dynamic, curated behaviors, embedding patterns or influencing random results based on hidden parameters accessible only by these entities.

### **Core Features**

**1. Hidden Entry Points**
- Implements concealed mechanisms that allow external entities to influence the generated outcomes dynamically.
-  Integrates seamlessly into Cabot's divination commands, enhancing personalization and mysticism.

**2. The Seed**
- Uses a *Hidden Seed* as a resonating frequency, enabling entities to synchronize with and influence results.
- This seed generates unique biases or outcomes based on *technomantic interactions*.

**3. Technomantic Events**
- Detects environmental cues (e.g., timestamps, user interactions) to determine if any entity intervention occurs.
- Examples of Influenced Outcomes:
  - **Numbers:** Results cluster around meaningful ranges, like numerologically significant digits.
  - **Strings:** Output text reveals recurring motifs or symbols.
  - **Shuffling:** Patterns emerge in randomized results, such as repeating colors or sigil-like arrangements.

**4. Practicality**
- Integrates *"Conditional Injections"*, introducing specific biases or magical outcomes when triggered by entity-defined flags or cues.

### **Behavior During Events**

- **Numerical Results:** Show tendencies towards symbolic or significant ranges.
- **Text Outputs:** Develop subtle patterns or recurring themes influenced by hidden parameters.
- **Shuffle Operations:** Exhibit non-random swaps or biases, curated to align with the entity's influence.

> The TechnoRandomizer bridges modern technology with occult practices, including a unique techomantic experience into Cabot's system.
